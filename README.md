# Console Finances

## Project Description
 
I was tasked with writing a program that carries out an analysis of a financial dataset. The task was to calculate:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
